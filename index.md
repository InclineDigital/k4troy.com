Republican and Veteran Kay Friedly will serve on the Troy, Ohio City Council as a Member at Large to represent all citizens of Troy for the betterment and elevation of our city’s stature. Kay’s focus will be guided by:

* Strong Christian values 
* Constitutional and fiscal conservatism
* Local Republican viewpoints 

Troy is a great community, but residents have expressed concern in regards to a number of issues including too much road work in recent years, concerns with election integrity, an over abundance of city regulations, and high taxes. These are issues Kay would seek to address as a City Council Member.

Kay Friedly has been a resident of Troy for over 6 years, having been charmed by the town during a previous stay of 3 years. She is an Air Force Veteran and retired Registered Nurse. She is currently a Republican Party Central Committee member, representing Troy Precinct 
3-A.

Kay has volunteered for her church, Troy Literacy Council, the Miami County Republican Party, Miami County Liberty, Miami County Park District and at the Troy Strawberry Fesitival for various organizations.
